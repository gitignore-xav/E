# E.h
A C header that includes preprocessors defining everything to various amounts of the letter "E" for better readability.

### Installation
To install, download or copy the contents of `e.h` and place it in the directory of your C program. Alternatively, copy all of the code from `e.h` and paste it into your own file.

### Usage
This header file uses preprocessors to replace a large aomunt of syntax in C to the letter "E" for optimal readability. Unfortunateley, due to my newness to C, I was unable to convert everything into "E" for the most readable code possible.

The following (while self explanitory due to how readable the code is) prints "E", the equivalent of a Hello World program in C without this header.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "e.h"

E EE EEeee Eeeee EEeeee EEe
	e EEeee "E\n" EEeeee;

	EEE EEEe;
EEee
```

This example shows adding two integers, which are then printed to the terminal.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "e.h"

E EE EEeee Eeeee EEeeee EEe
	E ee EEeeeee EEEeeeeeeee;
	E eee EEeeeee EEEeeeeeeeeee;
	E eeee EEeeeee ee EEeeeeee eee;

	e EEeee "%d + %d = %d\n", ee, eee, eeee EEeeee;

	EEE EEEe;
EEee
```
